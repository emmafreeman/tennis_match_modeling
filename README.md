# tennis_match_modeling

Problem statement:

Given a dataset, tennis_match_data.csv, which contains historical information on a number of previous matches and the scoring history of the two competitors, create a model for the win probability of a given competitor based on the current match state (score). No prior information about the relative strength of the competitors is available.
